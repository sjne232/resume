                <h1>Project 2 - Sales Insights: Leveraging Pivot Tables and Excel</h1>

                <b>Overview:</b>  
                This project was designed to enhance my proficiency in Excel, focusing on advanced data analysis techniques, such as VLOOKUP, Pivot Tables, and Pivot Charts. The goal was to transform raw sales data into actionable insights through structured data cleaning, advanced data manipulation, and dynamic visual reporting.  
                <br><br>

                <b>Key Activities:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Data Cleaning and Transformation:</b> I started by cleaning and transforming the raw sales data, ensuring it was structured for meaningful analysis. This involved removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing data formats.</li>
                    <li><b>Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts:</b> I used Pivot Tables to aggregate and summarize large datasets, enabling in-depth analysis of sales performance across various dimensions (e.g., regions, products, time periods). I also created dynamic Pivot Charts to visualize key metrics like revenue, sales quantity, and growth trends.</li>
                    <li><b>Slicers for Data Filtering:</b> To enhance interactivity and streamline data exploration, I incorporated slicers. These slicers allow users to filter the data by specific criteria (such as product, region, or date range) and dynamically update the Pivot Tables and charts in real-time.</li>
                    <li><b>ID Search Functionality:</b> I developed a custom ID search functionality, allowing users to quickly retrieve specific records based on unique identifiers. This feature simplified the process of looking up detailed information about individual transactions or products.</li>
                    <li><b>Dynamic Visual Presentations:</b> To present the insights clearly and effectively, I designed visually engaging charts and graphs. These dynamic visuals were designed to provide a quick overview of sales trends, top-performing products, and market performance, helping decision-makers easily interpret the data.</li>
                </ul>

                <b>Outcome:</b>  
                By using Pivot Tables, VLOOKUP, and other advanced Excel features, I was able to create a robust reporting solution that not only streamlined data analysis but also provided interactive and intuitive visualizations. This project helped me develop a deeper understanding of Excel’s capabilities for business intelligence and reporting.

                <!--<h1>Project 2 - Sales Insights - Pivot Tables in Excel</h1>
                <b>Overview:</b> This project was used for me to gain more experience in Excel using VLOOKUP and Pivot charts. I cleaned and transformed the data, 
                created detailed pivot charts, and incorporated slicers for efficient data filtering. Additionally, I developed an ID search functionality to streamline 
                data retrieval and designed dynamic visuals to effectively present the insights. <br><br> <hr>
            
                <b>STEPS:</b> 
                
                <br> <b>STEP 1: </b>Created 3 new sheets:<br>
                a. Original Data – A sheet that preserves the raw, unaltered data, ensuring you always have a backup in case of errors.<br>
                b. Working Sheet – A sheet used for editing and manipulating the data. <br>
                c. Pivot Table Sheet – A sheet dedicated to creating and organizing all necessary pivot tables. <br>
                d. Dashboard Sheet – A sheet designed to display the final visualizations and insights.<br>
                
                <br><b>STEP 2: </b> Data Cleaning and Transformation <br>
                a. Removed all duplicates using the "Remove Duplicates" feature in Excel.<br>
                b. Improved data clarity by updating the Marital Status column, changing 'M' to "Married" and 'S' to "Single." 
                Similarly, the Gender column was updated by changing 'M' to "Male" and 'F' to "Female." This ensures the data 
                is as clear as possible for analysis, reducing the risk of confusion. <br>
                c. Used nested IF statements to categorize the age data into groups: Adolescent, Middle-aged, and Old. These 
                age categories enhance the usability of the data in the dashboard, compared to listing individual ages from 15 to 71.<br>
                
                <br> <b>STEP 3: </b>Created 3 Pivot Charts on a separate sheet. <br>
                a.	Average Income Per Purchase <br>
                b.	Customer Age bracket Per Purchase <br>
                c.	Customer Commute Per Purchase <br>

                <br> <b>STEP 4: </b>Created slicers to allow the user to filter the data!<br>
                a.	Added the slicer for Marital Status <br>
                b.	Also Added Region <br>
                c.	Also Added Education <br>

                <br> <b>STEP 5: </b>The last functionality added to the Dashboard was an ID search: This allows the user to type 
                in any User ID and the search will auto populate with all of the data related to that ID. <br>
