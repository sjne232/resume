                <b>Overview:</b> Developing Sales Insights for a Consumer Goods Company using SQL and Power BI.<br><br>
                <b>Problem:</b> AltiQ Hardware is facing challenges in effectively tracking sales and obtaining 
                key business insights. The company's Sales Director, Bob, currently relies on verbal communication with regional 
                managers in the North, South, and Central regions to gather critical information. For instance, Bob may need details 
                on last quarterâ€™s sales performance or projections for growth in the next quarter. However, these discussions are 
                informal, with no concrete data to support the insights being shared.<br><br>Bob has recently observed a decline in 
                sales and realizes that he needs reliable, evidence-based information to address the issue. In response, he requests 
                the regional managers to send him their sales data, and they submit multiple Excel files with thousands of rows of 
                data. Unfortunately, Bob struggles to make sense of this overwhelming data, preventing him from understanding the 
                current state of the business or identifying effective solutions for improving sales performance.<br><br>To address this, 
                Bob has asked us to create a comprehensive dashboard that consolidates all relevant sales data, providing clear
                visualizations for better decision-making. Additionally, Bob wants automated monthly email reminders to receive timely 
                updates on business performance and insights. <br><br>
                <b>Project Planning:</b>  Using an AIMS Grid we break up our project into 4 categories: Purpose, Stakeholder, End Result, 
                and Success Criteria. Under the <b>Purpose</b> section we have: To unlock sales insights that are not visible before sales
                team for decision support and automate theme to reduced manual time spent in data gathering. Under the <b>Stakeholders</b> 
                section we have: Sales Director, Marketing Team, Customer Service Team, Data Analytics Team, and IT. Under the <b>End Result</b>
                section we have: an automated dashboard providing quick and latest sales insights in order to support data driven decision making. 
                Lastly under the <b>Success Criteria</b> section we have: Dashboard(s) uncovering sales order insights with the latest data available
                Sales team able to make better decisions and prove 10% cost savings of total spend. Salse analust stop sata gathering manually in
                order to save 20% of their business time and reinvest in value added activity.  
                Notes: I am pulling data from a MySql Database into Power Bi to show this data
                STEPS: Data cleaning first, Getting rid of data that is not useful or accurate.
                DATABASE INFO: the amount of data given to us is 5 different tables. one is customers which has 38 entrys
                the next is Transactions which has 150,283 entrys
                Vocab: Online transaction processing (OLTP) is a type of database system that processes and stores data from transactions in real time<br>
                ETL stands for "extract, transform, and load"<br>
