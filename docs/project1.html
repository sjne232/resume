                <h1>Project 1 - Sales Insights - MySQL and Power Bi</h1>
                <b>Overview:</b> Developing Sales Insights for a Consumer Goods Company Based out of India using SQL and Power BI.<br><br> <hr>
                
                <b>Problem:</b> AltiQ Hardware is facing challenges in effectively tracking sales and obtaining 
                key business insights. The company's Sales Director, Bob, currently relies on verbal communication with regional 
                managers in the North, South, and Central regions of India to gather critical information. For instance, Bob may need details 
                on last quarterâ€™s sales performance or projections for growth in the next quarter. However, these discussions are 
                informal, with no concrete data to support the insights being shared.
                
                <br><br>Bob has recently observed a decline in sales and realizes that he needs reliable, evidence-based information to 
                address the issue. In response, he requests the regional managers to send him their sales data, and they submit multiple
                Excel files with thousands of rows of data. Unfortunately, Bob struggles to make sense of this overwhelming data, preventing him from understanding the 
                current state of the business or identifying effective solutions for improving sales performance.
                
                <br><br>To address this, Bob has asked us to create a comprehensive dashboard that consolidates all relevant sales data, providing clear
                visualizations for better decision-making. This dashboard needs to present annual revenue, sales quantity, revenue by market, sales quantity
                by market, Revenue trend, top five products and top 5 customers by revenue, and lastly you should be able to filter all of these charts by year 
                and month. Additionally, Bob wants automated monthly email reminders to receive timely 
                updates on business performance and insights. 
                
                <br><br><b>Purpose:</b>To unlock sales insights that are not visible before sales team for decision support and automate theme to
                reduced manual time spent in data gathering. 
                
                <br><b>Success Criteria:</b>Dashboard(s) uncovering sales order insights with the latest data available to make accurate and informed
                Adjustments.
                <hr>
                
                <b>STEPS:</b> 
                
                <br> <b>STEP 1: </b>Link Power Bi to MySql Database. I did by running a data base cales Sales with 5 tables. These tables are called
                customers, date, markets, products, and transitions. To link Power Bi to Mysql I just needed to sign in to my localhost using root and my password
                
                <br><b>STEP 2: </b>Data cleaning - to do this I transformed the data. I removed unnecessary values such as sale amount being <=0, removed any sales that 
                were in markets outside of India, and lastly created a new column to convert all USD currencys to INR currency in a new column called normalized_sales_amount.
                To do this last transformation I used a conditional column that said {"normalized_sales_amount", each if [currency] = "USD" or [currency] = "USD#(cr)" then[sales_amount]*75 
                else [sales_amount])}
                
                <br> <b>STEP 3: </b>Data Visualization - to create this dashboard I created a new table called buisMeasures. This table was used to calculate the revenue, by 
                creating a new measurement for revenue by using this formula : <b>"Revenue = SUM('sales transactions'[sales_amount])"</b>, then I created another measurement to
                caluclate Sales Quantity and this was done using this formula : <b>"SalesQuantity = SUM('sales transactions'[sales_qty])"</b>. Once these measurements were created I 
                I connected both of these two their own cards to present revenue and sales quantity. Then I four horizontal bar graphs, to show Revenue by Market, sales Quanity by market, 
                top 5 products by revenue, and top 5 customers by revenue. The last chart I used was a line chart to display revenue over time aka revenue trend. The Last requirement was
                to make this dashboard conditional by month and year to see the specifics by year and/or month. To do this I created 2 sliders, one for year and one for month, and I changed the 
                style of the slider to title to make it look nicer.
