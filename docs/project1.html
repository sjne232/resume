                <h1>Project 1 - Sales Insights: Leveraging MySQL and Power BI</h1>
                
                <hr>
                <b>Problem:</b>
                
                <br><br>AltiQ Hardware has faced challenges in effectively tracking and analyzing sales performance. The Sales Director, Bob, currently
                 relies on informal communication with regional managers across India to gather critical business insights. Unfortunately, these interactions 
                 lack concrete data and often rely on verbal reports, leading to inconsistencies and limited visibility into actual performance.
                
                <br><br>When Bob observed a decline in sales, he recognized the need for reliable, data-driven insights. He requested sales data from the regional managers, 
                who submitted numerous Excel files containing thousands of rows of data. 
                Bob struggled to analyze this overwhelming information, making it difficult to understand the root causes of the decline or identify improvement opportunities.
                
                <br><br> To address these challenges, Bob has asked us to build a centralized dashboard that consolidates sales data, providing visualizations to support 
                effective decision-making. The dashboard will highlight key metrics, including annual revenue, sales volume, market-specific performance,
                 top-performing products, and customers. Additionally, Bob requires automated monthly email reports to keep him updated on business performance and trends.

                <br><br><b>Purpose:</b>The goal of this project is to uncover hidden sales insights, reduce manual effort in data gathering, and enable data-driven decision-making 
                through an interactive and automated dashboard.
                
                <br><b>Success Criteria:</b> The project will be deemed successful when the dashboard provides clear and up-to-date sales insights, allowing the Sales Director and 
                team to make informed adjustments to sales strategies and improve performance.

                <b>Project Steps:</b> 
                
                <br> <b>STEP 1: </b> Integrating Power BI with MySQL - The first step involved linking Power BI to the MySQL database.
                I created a database called Sales, which consists of five key tables: customers, date, markets, products, and transactions. 
                I connected Power BI to the database using localhost credentials (root and password) to ensure seamless data integration.
                
                <br><b>STEP 2: </b> Data Cleaning and Transformation - Next, I focused on cleaning the data to ensure its accuracy and relevance. This included:
                <ul>
                  <li>Removing rows where the sales amount was less than or equal to zero.</li>
                  <li>Filtering out sales transactions outside of India.</li>
                  <li>Creating a new column called normalized_sales_amount to convert all USD-based sales figures into INR using a conditional formula: <br>
                  normalized_sales_amount = IF([currency] = "USD" OR [currency] = "USD#(cr)", [sales_amount] * 75, [sales_amount]) </li>
                </ul>

                <br> <b>STEP 3: </b> Data Visualization and Dashboard Creation - To provide meaningful insights, I designed an interactive dashboard using Power BI:
                <ul>
                  <li>I created a new table called businessMeasures to calculate key metrics, such as revenue and sales quantity.</li>
                  <li>The revenue was calculated using the formula:
                    Revenue = SUM('sales transactions'[sales_amount])</li>
                  <li>Sales quantity was calculated using the formula:
                    SalesQuantity = SUM('sales transactions'[sales_qty])</li>
                  </li>
                </ul>  
                <br>
                    I then created visual components to display these metrics, including:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Revenue and Sales Quantity cards.</li>
                    <li>Four horizontal bar charts displaying:
                      <ul>
                        <li>Revenue by market</li>
                        <li>Sales quantity by market</li>
                        <li>Top 5 products by revenue</li>
                        <li>Top 5 customers by revenue</li>
                      </ul>
                    <li>A line chart showing the revenue trend over time.
                  </ul>
                Additionally, to meet the requirement of filtering by year and month, I created two interactive sliders (one for the year and one for the month)
                 that allow users to drill down into specific time periods. 
                
                 <br> <b>STEP 4:</b> Automation - Lastly, I implemented an automated monthly email reminder feature to provide Bob with timely updates on sales 
                 performance and insights, reducing the need for manual data retrieval.
